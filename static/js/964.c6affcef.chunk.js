I am a member of their [Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors Program](https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/eh/index.html) and [Mathematics Honors Program](https://www.math.tamu.edu/undergraduate/honors/honorsmajor.html), double majoring in [Computer Science](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) and [Applied Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.tamu.edu/) with a minor in [Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/). I have a passion for learning new things in technology and developing applications. I am currently interning as a Full Stack Software Engineer at AT&T in Dallas TX. I am looking for a tech company to kickstart my career at once I graduate in May 2023.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt AT&T I have been able to not only expand my technical knowledge of modern technologies such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org), and [CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), but also expand my social knowledge of how to navigate the tech industry. I am looking forward to returning to TAMU for my senior year where I can employ these experiences into my coursework and research. I have begun the job hunt for my first job out of college and if you think you could help me, please feel free to contact me.\n\n# I enjoy\n\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98478125-dayton-berezoski)\n- Playing French Horn\n- Fall Weather\n- Playing Video Games\n- Learning Something New\n",renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
